        Note the red embroidery around the base of the dress of the High Priestess.</br>
        "Embroidery patterns and needlework techniques abound in Ukraine, with each region identifiable through its own unique symbolic patterns, motifs and colour codes. There are about 200 different documented stitches and ornamental styles in Ukraine.</br>
        The history of embroidery in Ukraine can be traced as far back as the Scythians, an ancient nomadic group that dominated the Eurasian Steppe from present-day Iran to Mongolia between the 7th and 3rd centuries BC, and settled in large groups in what became modern-day Ukraine.</br>
        Although embroidery is found globally, it took on particular cultural significance in Ukraine where it has long been the most widespread decorative art.</br>
        Cossacks who ruled parts of independent Ukraine in the 16th and 17th centuries believed the embroidery patterns on their shirts protected them in battle and gave them strength.</br>
        Geometric patterns like the square to denote the earth, the rhombus for fertility, circles for the sun, triangles for eternal life and chevrons to represent femininity, masculinity, and spirituality were common motifs, along with zoomorphic and nature-inspired patterns.</br>
        Elaborate floral patterns in gold and silver thread became highly popular among the Ukrainian Cossack elite, which held power until they were crushed by the Russian Empire. Apart from the attire of peasants, soldiers and the elite, rushnyks or hand towels featuring elaborate red thread embroidery on white linen, were made and given as presents to mark all the important milestones of life - from births and baptisms to weddings and funerals."</br>
        From <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/1/22/the-ukrainians-using-embroidery-to-stand-up-to-russia">Ukrainian embroidery</a>
        ''',
        'page_of_swords':'''
        The Ukrainian Cossack has come to symbolize Ukraine's ethnic image, much like the medieval knight of Western Europe or the Samurai of Japan. In fact, only a minority of Ukrainians belonged to this famed social group - but their influence on history, culture, and the psychology of the country was deeply profound.</br>
        Legends say that there were unusual people called "Kharakternyks" among the Cossacks. People believed that they originated from ancient pagan magicians who possessed secret knowledge and were even able to predict the future.</br>
        Some historians maintain that after the adoption of Christianity in Kyivan Rus, pagan magicians were persecuted and moved to the wild steppe where the Zaporizhian Sich was established later.</br>
        There, Kharakternyks taught warriors martial arts, rituals, and customs.</br>
        </br>
        Supposedly, the Kharakternyks could neither be burned in fire nor be drowned in water. They were said to speak twelve languages, turn into wolves and other animals, catch bullets and kernels with their hands, walk on water and even breath under water.</br>
        Legend has it that they lived for a very long time and were extremely strong – and only silver bullets could kill them.</br>

        Blue and yellow are the national colors of Ukraine. In thinking about the great plains the cossacks roamed, there was a lot of sun, sky and freedom. 
        There is a closeness with nature and a sheer joy at being of the child in the Sun card that is a beautiful expression of being. 
        As wild as the wilderness may be, it is the true home of our inner child. Our place of true freedom. It is a gift given to us.

He carries a stick over his shoulder and on the bag on the end of the stick is the figure of a bird\'s head or an eagle. A symbol of his association with the element of air.Also, pehaps a hidden reference to an angel from the Temperance and Wheel of Fortune card.The dog is small and white, playful and jumping around. In the Ashhtavakra Gita it is said, "The fool thinks peace comes by controlling the mind. He will never attain it. The wise one knows Truth, and is stillness itself." The fool represents the wonderment, joy and delight of a completely innocent child. The card also represents the inexperience and ignorance that allows a baby to make unimaginable mistakes. The key to this card is seeing that the Fool is so close to and precious to the Divine and yet so... foolish. Chogyam Trungpa once asked, "Whatever happend to the joy and wonderment of being a child?" The answer is knowing. We came to know to much and are no longer surprised and delighted by life. There is a real beauty to natural innocence, of being in flow, and there is real tragedy for those who act foolishly and squander their resources in life. How can we remain innocent and close to God while not acting without wisdom?'))

The message of the shadow Christ as Judas is called is that we may not know our purpose, but the importance of our lives may be beyond imagining or societal approval. There is a sense of sacrifice as well. In another hanged man archetype, Odin sacrifices his eye in Mimir\'s well and he throws himself on his spear Gungnir in a kind of symbolic, ritual suicide. He then hangs himself from the tree Yggdrasil for nine days and nine nights in order to gain knowledge of other worlds and be able to understand the runes.

When fear or disgust or other negative emotions arise, how do we deal with them? If the point is to prepare for death, then surely this little taste of something scary doesn\'t compare. The practitioner gets an experience of fear or negativity. There is no way to be always awake or always happy. We must submit to occassional negative experience. And so this practice is about developing equanimity. Its about learning that the real problem is the emotions themselves. Its about learning to let the storm come and pass without reaction.

            You are not ashamed and do not regret it, since insofar as you live the life of your fellow beings and descend to their lowliness you also climb into the holy stream of common life, where you are no longer an individual on a high mountain, but a fish among fish, a frog among frogs.</br>
            Your heights are your own mountain, which belongs to you and you alone. There you are individual and live your very own life.</br>
            </br>
            If you live your own life, you do not live the common life, which is always continuing and never-ending, the life of history and the inalienable and ever-present burdens and products of the human race.</br>
            There you live the endlessness of being, but not becoming. Becoming belongs to the heights and is full of torment. How can you become if you never are?</br>
            Therefore you need your bottommost, since there you are. But therefore you also need your heights, since there you become."</br>

            "Although we may not be a ch&#246;d practitioner who deliberately goes to scary places, we still meet plenty of frightening inner demons, such as depression, anger, and anxiety. When this happens we have the opportunity to feed, not fight, these demons with the nectar of love and compassion. This goes against the grain of ego-clinging and allows the inner demons to transform into allies.</br>
            Since these places provoke fear and clinging to the body, the offering is a direct confrontation with the ego. Many kinds of guests are invited to this imagined banquet, including personified forms of diseases, fears, and demons. As the guests arrive for the feast, ch&#246;d practitioners keep the view of three-fold emptiness and offer their body, which they visualize as nectar that satisfies all desires. The intensity of making the body offering in a frightening place is designed to push the practitioner into a state free from all clinging." ~ Tsultrim Allione'''},

            When we speak of opening and surrendering as, for instance, in the case of anger, it does not mean we should actually go out and hit someone on the spot.</br>
            That seems to be more a way of feeding ego rather than a way of exposing your anger properly, seeing its real living quality.</br>
            This applies to exposing yourself in general. It is a matter of seeing the basic quality of the situation, as it is, rather than trying to do somethin with it.</br>
            Of course if one is completely open to the situation without any preconceptions, then one would know which action is right and which is unskillful.</br>
            If a particular course of action would be clumsy and unskilled, then you would not take that fork in the road; you would take the fork of skillful and creative action.</br>
